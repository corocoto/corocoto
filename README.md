## Participation in open source
* [**bpmn.io**](https://bpmn.io/):

  Made solid contributions in core modeling libraries, like: [**bpmn-auto-layout**](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout), [**bpmn-js**](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js), and [**bpmn-js-i18n**](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n).
  * Resolved the problem of working the [**bpmn-auto-layout**](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout) library in the browser environment.

    Right now devs can consume it in a browser and Node.js. Also, these changes allowed maintainers to close a couple of previously created issues. For example, it was [a problem using the library in React](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout/issues/22) and [threw the runtime error "TypeError: BpmnModdle is not a constructor"](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout/issues/18).
  * [Updated and actualized Russian locale](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n/pull/21) for the [internationalization package](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n)
  * Added opportunity to [translate _Append TextAnnotation_ context pad action](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/1932) on properly locale at [`bpmn-js`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js)
* [**tiged**](https://github.com/tiged/tiged):
  * Resolved the ["could not find commit hash for HEAD" problem](https://github.com/tiged/tiged/issues/90), that happened at the moment of fetching data from repo
* [**Doka**](https://doka.guide/): 
  * Published thought-provoking articles on the inner workings of JavaScript, including the [`queueMicrotask()`](https://doka.guide/js/queuemicrotask/) function and the [`Math.random()` algorithm](https://doka.guide/js/math-random/#detali-realizacii);
  * Shared knowledge of [`console.log()` excellent capability](https://doka.guide/js/console-log/#osobennost-raboty-v-brauzere) in the browser environment.
  * Contributed valuable information on [additional attributes and optimized `<link>` methods](https://doka.guide/html/link/#optimizaciya).
  * Wrote [a recommendation for using the persistent data storage mode in the browser](https://doka.guide/js/local-storage/#artyom-gusev-sovetuet). The section includes a description of the features and limitations of this mode, examples, as well as available methods.
* [**Feature-Sliced Design**](https://feature-sliced.design/):
  * Contributed and actualized some sections from [the **"Tutorial"** article](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/tutorial):
    * https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/pull/608
    * https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/pull/609   
* [**`day.js`**](https://day.js.org/):
  * Worked on documentation translation.
